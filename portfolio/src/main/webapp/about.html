          Hi! My name is Jan Bobda, I'm a Sophomore at the University of Arkansas studying Computer Science with a minor in Physics in the College of Engineering.
          When I get the opportunity to, I love traveling and seeing different parts of the world and experiencing different cultures. I've gotten the chance to visit Europe, North America, and Africa
          and one day I hope to visit Asia and experience all the various cultures there. Some of my hobbies include Sports like Soccer, Volleyball and Ping Pong as well as playing some of my favorite video games late into the night.
          I'd consider myself a very competitive person in my personal life which is why I spend alot of my free time engaging in my hobbies at a competitive level.
          I also love just hanging out with friends on a weekend and playing our favorite video games such as Super Smash Brothers or League of Legends.
