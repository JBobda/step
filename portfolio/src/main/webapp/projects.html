        <p class="description">
          Program that sorts a list of randomly arranged numbers using different sorting algorithms. This process is visualized using bars of varying heights, and them being sorted according to those heights.
          This program is made with C++ and the SFML and was primarily a method for me to practice implementing sorting algorithms as well as using SFML to develop visual C++ applications.

        <p class="description">
          A Python Discord Bot that uses Smash Elo ratings to calculate probabilities of Super Smash brothers games and adjusts Elo rankings properly.
          I developed this application so that me and my friends can keep up who is the best among us in the game statistically. It uses discord as an interface and uses python as a backend with firebase as a database.
