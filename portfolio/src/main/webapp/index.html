        My name is Jan, I just completed my freshman year at the University of Arkansas studying Computer Science and I'm a STEP Intern on the News team.
        Some of my hobbies include Sports ranging from Soccer to Volleyball and Ping Pong as well as video games. I love traveling and seeing different parts of the world.
        The Selfie of me above is of me in Berlin Germany at the Brandernburger Tor on a High School exchange trip.
